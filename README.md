## Project Phase 1 Overview:

The initial phase of the project is focused on the collection of “Twitter” data. More than 100,000 tweets have been collected. The hashtags and URLs used in these tweets have been filtered through extraction using appropriate code. Along with the extraction, word count is performed identifying the number of times each of the hashtags and URLs are used within the tweets, highlighting the most and least popular data items. This creates a foundation for the data analysis to be done from the information collected and filtered.
